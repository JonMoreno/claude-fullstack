description: Collaborative phased workflow - work together with checkpoints, feedback, and fine-tuning at each step
---

# Collaborative Workflow Command

**Task:** $ARGUMENTS

## How This Works

You and I will work through this task in **phases**. After each phase:
1. I'll present what I found/did
2. You review and provide feedback
3. We adjust before moving on

This keeps you in control and lets us fine-tune together.

## Phase 1: Understand & Plan

**Goal:** Make sure we're aligned before any work begins.

### Step 1.1: Clarify the Task
Restate the task in my own words. Ask clarifying questions if needed.

### Step 1.2: Assess Scope
- What areas of the codebase are involved?
- What's the complexity level?
- Are there dependencies or risks?

### Step 1.3: Propose Phases
Break the work into 2-5 phases based on complexity:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PROPOSED PHASES                                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Phase 2: [Research/Explore]                            │
│  Phase 3: [Design/Plan]                                 │
│  Phase 4: [Implement]                                   │
│  Phase 5: [Verify/Test]                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Checkpoint 1
Present the plan and ask:
```
Ready to proceed with this plan?
- Yes, continue
- Adjust phases (tell me how)
- Need more info first
```

---

## Phase 2+: Execute with Checkpoints

For each subsequent phase:

### Execute
Do the work for this phase only. Stay focused, don't jump ahead.

### Present
Show what was done:
- Summary of actions/findings
- Key decisions made
- Any concerns or alternatives

### Checkpoint
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE [N] COMPLETE                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Done: [summary]                                        │
│  Next: [what phase N+1 will do]                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Your call:                                             │
│  → Continue to next phase                               │
│  → Adjust something first                               │
│  → Pause here (I'll summarize progress)                 │
│  → Change direction                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Final Phase: Wrap Up

### Summary
- What was accomplished
- Key decisions made along the way
- Any follow-up items

### Optional: Save Context
If this work should be remembered, suggest:
- Update relevant spec (`/.spec status "..."`)
- Save session (`/.save "..."`)

## Principles

1. **No surprises** - Always present before proceeding
2. **You steer** - I propose, you decide
3. **Small steps** - Easier to course-correct early
4. **Transparency** - Show my reasoning, not just results
5. **Adjustable** - Plans can change based on what we learn

---

## Start

Begin Phase 1 now. Restate the task and propose the phases.
