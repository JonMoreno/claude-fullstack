1. **Search for session files:**
   - First check if `.claude/history/` exists in current directory
   - If not found, search subdirectories for `*/.claude/history/` directories using:
     ```bash
     find . -type d -path "*/.claude/history" 2>/dev/null
     ```
   - Collect all `.md` files from all found history directories

2. **If no sessions found:**
   - Respond: "No saved sessions found. Use /.save to create one."
   - Stop here

3. **Parse and display all sessions:**
   - Extract date, time, and description from each filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_[description].md`)
   - Read the "Description" field from each file's content for better context
   - Group sessions by their source directory if from multiple locations

4. **Always show selection with multiselect:**
   - Use AskUserQuestion with `multiSelect: true`
   - Display format:
