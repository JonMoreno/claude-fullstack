Set up workspace configuration for managing multiple feature branches with git worktrees.

1. Use Bash to scan the current directory and detect repositories
2. Check if `.claude/workspace-config.json` already exists
3. Use AskUserQuestion to gather user preferences for IDE, base branch, and feature prefix
4. Auto-detect framework types (Laravel, Next.js, Node.js) and set appropriate defaults
5. Create the configuration JSON with proper settings for each repository
6. Save to `.claude/workspace-config.json` using Write tool
7. Validate the configuration and show a summary

The configuration should include:
- projectRoot: current working directory
- repos: array with each repo's name, type, port, commands, and files to copy
- ide: user's preferred IDE command
- baseBranch: branch to create features from
- featurePrefix: naming pattern for feature branches

For Laravel repos, default to:
- port: 8000
- startCommand: "php artisan serve"
- installCommand: "composer install"
- filesToCopy: [".env", ".env.testing"]
- directoriesToCopy: ["storage/app", "storage/framework"]
- freshDirectories: ["storage/logs"]

For Next.js repos, default to:
- port: 3000
- startCommand: "npm run dev"
- installCommand: "npm install"
- filesToCopy: [".env", ".env.local"]

After creating configuration, display summary and list available commands.
