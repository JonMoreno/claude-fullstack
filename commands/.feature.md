# Create New Feature

Create a new feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Planning Phase
1. **Clarify Requirements**
   Ask 2-3 critical questions about:
   - Expected behavior and edge cases
   - Which existing components to integrate with
   - Any specific constraints or preferences
   
   Wait for answers before proceeding.

2. **Analyze & Plan**
   - Break down the feature into clear components
   - Identify what needs backend work
   - Identify what needs frontend work
   - Determine testing requirements

## Execution Phase
3. **Delegate to Specialized Agents**
   - Use backend agent for API endpoints, database schemas, server logic
   - Use frontend agent for UI components, state management, styling
   - Use test agent for comprehensive test coverage
   
4. **Work in Parallel**
   - Backend and frontend agents should work simultaneously
   - Test agent creates tests as components are being built

## Integration Phase
5. **Integrate Components**
   - Wire up backend endpoints to frontend
   - Configure routing and navigation
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Validate data flow

## Validation Phase
6. **Final Checks**
   - Run all tests
   - Check for TypeScript errors
   - Verify linting passes
   - Test the feature end-to-end

## Best Practices
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Include proper error handling
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Ensure responsive design for frontend work

Remember: Use sub-agents for parallel development to speed up implementation!
