# Context/Status

Get full context: Deeply understand this entire codebase - read everything, understand business logic, know the tech stack.
Learn the codebase, see current work, know what's next.

## Part 1: Learn The Codebase (First Time Only)
If this is your first time analyzing this repo OR user says "reanalyze":
1. Read package files (package.json, composer.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
2. Scan main directories - understand full structure
3. Read key files to understand what this app DOES (business logic)
4. Map architecture and data flow
5. Note all major libraries/frameworks and their purposes
6. Understand coding patterns and conventions
7. Identify database schema and models
8. Find API routes/endpoints
9. Understand authentication/authorization approach

**Scan broadly but efficiently - grep, glob, read strategic files**

**Goal: Load COMPLETE project context into memory**
